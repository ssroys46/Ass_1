    <p>The Boston Celtics, currently the top team in the NBA, dominated the Brooklyn Nets in a one-sided victory on Wednesday.

        Meanwhile, despite the defeat, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors made history as he became the first player in NBA history to successfully make at least seven three-point shots in four consecutive games. However, the Warriors were unable to maintain their 15-point lead at home and ended up losing to the Los Angeles Clippers.
        
        In the game against the Nets, Derrick White of the Celtics scored 27 points, while Jayson Tatum added 20 points, leading their team to a 136-86 victory. This win marked the fifth-largest victory in the Celtics' history, dating back to 1946.
        
        The Celtics have been on a winning streak, securing their sixth consecutive win. Kristaps Porzingis contributed 15 points, all of which were scored in the first half of the game.</p>

        <div>
        <p>Opener Ben Duckett smashed a century to lead England's attacking reply of 207-2 on Friday after Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin reached 500 Test wickets in the third match of the series.

            The left-handed Duckett reached his third Test hundred in 88 balls as England reached 207-2 to cut their deficit after they bowled out India for 445 on day two in Rajkot.
            
            Duckett, on 133, and Joe Root, on nine, were batting at close of play. The tourists still trail India by 238 runs.</p>

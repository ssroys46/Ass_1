        <p>The focus of the study is on the activities of recognized threat actors engaging in activities such as prompt injections, attempted misuse of LLMs, and instances of fraud.

            The findings presented in the research have been collected from known threat actor infrastructure identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, and shared with OpenAI to identify potential malicious use or abuse of their platform.
            
            The threat actors highlighted in the blog post serve as a representative sample of observed activities, showcasing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that the industry should prioritise tracking for enhanced awareness and mitigation.
            
            Forest Blizzard (linked to Russian military intelligence), for instance, has been actively targeting organizations related to Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine. The threat actor engages in LLMs-informed reconnaissance, using LLMS to grasp satellite communication protocols, radar imaging technologies, and specific technical parameters. Forest Blizzard also employs LLM-enhanced scripting techniques, seeking support in fundamental scripting tasks such as file manipulation, data selection, regular expressions, and multiprocessing.</p>
